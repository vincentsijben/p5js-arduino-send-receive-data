# p5js arduino send receive

Small project to test speed of serial communication between p5js and arduino, sending over rgb colors for a 10x10 led matrix.
For 1201 characters, it takes approx. 300ms to send and receive back with a baudrate of 115200.

# install
* install the https://github.com/p5-serial/p5.serialport app to be able to map the serial bus to a web socket so p5js can communicate.
